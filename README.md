## Personal Website Testing Area
This is going to be where I play around with what I'm going to be learning
on-the-job as I begin diving more into web development. As I do so, I plan on at
least eventually implementing the changes on [my personal
website](www.richardconnorjohnstone.com), so the content may, over time, tend
towards that endpoint. Right now I'm keeping it quick and dirty with a template
I found online, though as I learn more (if I have time) I may work on
implementing more of my own work.

And since github (as far as I can tell) doesn't provide a damn link to the page
on the repo site:
