          Still in Progress

          <h2>Beginnings in Louisville, Kentucky</h2>
          While I’m currently an Aerospace Engineering Student at the University of Colorado – Boulder, I consider myself, as well, to be a lifelong learner. I graduated from DuPont Manual High School in 2011 with no real guiding principles save a deep (and sometimes intense) curiosity for Math and Physics. When I took that curiosity to the University of Kentucky I enrolled for Mechanical Engineering. I found the work exciting, but it didn’t prove to be quite enough. So I decided to pursue, concurrently, a degree in Physics as well. I believe the knowledge gained in earning that degree provided me with a far deeper and broader well of fundamental technical knowledge that informs my design choices.

          <h2>Co-op Rotations at GE and Belcan Aerospace</h2>
          My first co-op rotation during my time at UK was a real eye-opening time for me. I  was a Design Co-op for General Electric in the Appliance Park in Louisville, Kentucky working in the Dishwasher Rack team. In a lot of ways, I’ve come to realize that I was not at all ready to be tossed from the relaxed, but constant world of academia into the rigors of industry. But hindsight is 20-20. It was only through this challenge that I realized what it would take to perform well in such an organized company. Along the way, I picked up a variety of technical skills and knowledge as well.  These include firsthand experience with plastic injection molding design, Solidworks, and Finite Element Analysis.

          A few semesters later, I entered into a second rotation at GE. This time I worked as a co-op on the Range team on a bleeding-edge program for freestanding ovens. It was this rotation that really cemented my love of design as I got to dig deep into my technical reservoirs every day and explore concepts that were totally new to me. This turned out to be an incredible learning experience for me in terms of Heat Transfer, particularly radiation.

          It was around this time that I had begun to discover that my true passion was for Aerospace Engineering. Although such a program isn’t offered at the University of Kentucky, I made it work anyway. I made sure to include as many aerodynamic and space-related classes into my schedule as possible, hoping to soak it all in. By my senior year — with luck — I managed to get an internship at Belcan Aerospace for my third and final school co-op rotation. It was here that I gained firsthand experience in using CATIA v5 and all of the ins and outs of working in the Aerospace field.

          <h2>Design Lead at RSI, Inc.</h2>
          Upon graduation, I worked as a Mechanical Engineer for RSI, Inc. designing material handling systems for big-name customers such as Spirit Aerosystems, Col-met, Daimler, and others as the Lead Design Engineer. It was fulfilling working for a small company and I’ve relished the opportunity to have so much responsibility as a fresh engineer. I’ve been responsible for entire system-level redesigns of the standard in-floor drive system. I’ve also been providing and improving drawings for everything from the floor-plan layout to the tiniest machined components for manufacturing.

          <h2>Design Engineer at Lockheed Martin</h2>
          Eager to learn a bit more about life as an engineer at a larger company, I decided to apply for (and was accepted to) a position as a design engineer at Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control in Lexington, KY. This was a very valuable learning experience for me, as I got to see firsthand how the work is organized in such a large company and how a proper chain of responsibility works in the design process. I was able to work firsthand on the design improvements for the US Army GMV 1.1 project, which was a very exciting experience.

          <h2>Today</h2>
          Currently, I am a student of Aerospace Engineering at the University of Colorado – Boulder, pursuing a Masters Degree in Astrodynamics. School has only just begun, but I’m very excited to be digging back into the knowledge that will hopefully inform my career as an engineer. And I’m especially excited to be specializing in the Space industry in a location that is so rife with industry and innovation!

          When I’m not working on engineering projects, I like to build upon my base of skills as a person. Recently, I finished earning my Private Pilot License, a dream I’ve had for many years, as well as earning my scuba diving license. When I’m not flying, I can usually be found rock climbing, learning wood-working, taking on new challenges in programming, or reading about aviation and space-exploration history.
