          <par>I don't really know if I'm going to stick to this whole blog thing or
          not (I will certainly try, and at the very worst, I'll write about as
          many blog posts as I did on my previous site), but this time around,
          at the very least, I've got a bit of an idea.</par>

          <h2> My Blog Idea </h2>

          <par> Every day (or at least as often as I can remember and have time)
          I try to log something into my journal. This is really useful for me
          to keep my thoughts straight, to keep a log of my emotions, and to
          look back on memories in my life, good and bad. What I would like to
          do is, each week, compile the past 7 entries in my journal into a
          single cohesive story from the week. I'd like to talk a little bit
          about what I did, what the highlights were, what parts were bad, etc.
          What I'm kind of hoping falls out of that are a few things: </par>

          <ul>
            <li> Improvement in my web development skills </li>
            <li> Improvement in my writing skills </li>
            <li> A more cohesive and thoughtful account of my week than I can
              generally get from my journal entries </li>
            <li> A portal into my life that my family and friends can look
              through and see what I've been up to </li>
            <li> Ideas as I write about my week that could lead to occasional
              more general blog posts (perhaps to be read be people I don't even
              know!) </li>
          </ul>

          <h2> Why I Plan to Write General Articles </h2>

          <par> That last part is more of a goal in my writing than anything
          else. But I do think that I'll come up with interesting things to
          write about here and there. For instance, a few weeks ago I just
          bouldered my first problem of a certain grade. Naturally, that would
          have made the weekly recap, but many of my family members wouldn't
          really understand the news. So I might write a companion piece
          explaining bouldering grades and the history of them. It could be an
          interesting article in its own right, but also inform my parents and
          family about what kind of an accomplishment it was. </par>

          <h2> Nuts and Bolts </h2>

          <par> There are a whole bunch of things I'll have to do to make this
          happen. In the future, perhaps I'll elaborate into this in more
          detail, but for now I do at least want to get a few of them listed
          out. In order to improve my web development skills I'll need to
          continually add features to the website. I don't think that should be
          too hard, I've been enjoying the process so far. In order to improve
          my writing skills I'll need to simply write often. In order to provide
          a portal into my life, it would certainly be nice if I could start
          building out features like comments, etc. that allows others to
          interact with the site as well (and me, by extension). </par>

          <par> Anyway, these are just a few ideas I've been having and wanted
          to put down onto (digital) paper. Thanks for bearing with me! </par>
